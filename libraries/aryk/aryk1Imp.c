void aryk1Imp( HDSLoc *loc, AryACB **acb, int *status ) {
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     aryk1Imp

*  Purpose:
*     Import an array structure into the ACB.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryk1Imp( HDSLoc *loc, AryACB **acb, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine imports an array data structure, identified by its
*     HDS locator, returning a pointer to the base array ACB structure
*     allocated for it. This routine detects if the same data object
*     has previously been imported and takes account of this possibility.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        HDS locator to the data object to be imported.
*     acb
*        Address of a variable in which to return the pointer to the
*        resulting base array ACB structure.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If STATUS is set on entry, then NULL will be returned for the
*     ACB pointer, although no further processing will occur.
*     -  A value of NULL will also be returned if the routine fails
*     for any reason.
