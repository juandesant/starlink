*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Write values to an n-dimensional subregion of an HDS object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void CGEN_FUNCTION(aryk1Ptn)( int bad, int ndim, const hdsdim *lbnda,
*                                  const hdsdim *ubnda,  const CGEN_TYPE *array,
*                                  const hdsdim *lsub, const hdsdim *usub,

*                                  const char *htype, HDSLoc *loc, int *dce,
*                                  int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine writes to an n-dimensional subregion of a numeric HDS
*     array, taking the data from an n-dimensional subregion of a C
*     array and making use of lower and upper bounds information for
*     both arrays. Data type conversion is performed if necessary, with
*     bad pixel testing if required.

*  Parameters:
*     bad
*        Whether it is necessary to check for "bad" values during data
*        type conversions.
*     ndim
*        Number of array (and HDS object) dimensions.
*     lbnda
*        Lower bounds of input array.
*     ubnda
*        Upper bounds of input array.
*     array
*        Input array.
*     lsub
*        Lower bounds of subregion to be written.
*     usub
*        Upper bounds of subregion to be written..
*     lbndd
*        Lower bounds of the HDS object.
*     ubndd
*        Upper bounds of the HDS object.
*     htype
*        The data type of the HDS object. This should be a primitive
*        numeric HDS data type string (case insensitive).
*     loc
*        Locator to HDS object.
*     dce
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether an error occurred
*        during data type conversion.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  It is assumed that the input array and the output data object
*     have the same number of dimensions.  If this is not the case
*     intrinsically, then the "ndim" argument should be set to match
*     whichever object has the larger dimensionality and the dimension
*     bounds of the other object (and possibly of the subregion also)
*     should be padded to match this dimensionality, normally with 1's.
*     It does not matter that the value of "ndim" may not match the
*     actual dimensionality of the HDS object in such cases.
*     -  The lower and upper bounds of the subregion to be written must
*     lie within the bounds of both the input array and the output data
*     object, although the routine does not check for this.
*     -  The output data object must be suitable for vectorisation using
*     the HDS routine datVec.

*  Algorithm:
*     This routine is derived logically from a recursive treatment of
*     the problem of traversing an arbitrary number of array dimensions
*     whilst copying data to a subregion in each dimension. It may be
*     written schematically as follows...
*
*        procedure LOOP( I )
*           for DIM( I ) from LSUB( I ) to USUB( I ) do
*              if ( I = DCONTG ) then
*                 <copy a contiguous block of data>
*                 return
*              else
*                 LOOP( I - 1 )
*              end
*           end
*        end
*
*     A call of LOOP( NDIM ) then performs the entire data transfer
*     operation. The dimension DCONTG is chosen to be the highest
*     dimension where a contiguous block of data may be transferred (in
*     the worst case it will be 1).
*
*     Since Fortran does not allow recursive subroutine calls, they are
*     simulated here by branching back to the start of the algorithm,
*     having saved the previous dimension index in an appropriate element
*     of an array. A similar process (in reverse) is used to simulate a
*     return from the recursively invoked algorithm. To avoid branching
*     back into the range of a DO loop, looping has to be implemented
*     using IF and GO TO statements.
*
*     The algorithm operates as follows:
*        -  Check that the HTYPE argument is valid and convert it to upper
*        case. Report an error if it is not valid.
*        -  Initialise.
*        -  Find the highest dimension in which it is possible to transfer
*        contiguous data.
*        -  Set up strides for each dimension for both the input array and
*        the output data object.
*        -  Vectorise the output object and initialise pointers into the
*        input and output data streams.
*        -  Invoke the recursive algorithm.
*        -  Set pointers to the start and end of the data regions to be
*        skipped (in front of the subregion) in the current dimension.
*        -  If the current dimension allows contiguous data to be
*        transferred, then obtain a locator to a slice of the output data
*        object to receive the values to be transferred.
*        -  Transfer a contiguous block of data (with data type conversion
*        if necessary) and annul the slice locator.
*        -  If contiguous data cannot be transferred at the current
*        dimension, then invoke the algorithm again to handle the next
*        lower dimension.
*        -  Set pointers to the start and end of the data regions to be
*        skipped (after the subregion) in the current dimension.
*        -  Return from the recursive algorithm.
*        -  Annul the locator to the vectorised output object.
