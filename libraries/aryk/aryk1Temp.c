*  Name:
*     aryk1Temp

*  Purpose:
*     Create a temporary HDS object.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryk1Temp( const char *type, int ndim, const hdsdim *dim,
*                    HDSLoc **loc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine creates a temporary HDS object with the specified
*     type and shape. On the first invocation a temporary structure is
*     created to contain such objects. Subsequently, temporary objects
*     are created within this enclosing structure.

*  Parameters:
*     type
*        HDS type of object to be created.
*     ndim
*        Number of object dimensions.
*     dim
*        Pointer to array of object dimensions.
*     loc
*        Address at which to return a locator to the temporary object.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine is a work-around to avoid the problems associated
*     with calling datTemp if the objects created must subsequently be
*     erased.
