*  Name:
*     ary1Cmtmp

*  Purpose:
*     Create and map a temporary workspace array.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Cmtmp( const char *type, int ndim, const hdsdim *dim,
*                     HDSLoc **loc, void **pntr, int *status ) {

*  Description:
*     The routine creates a temporary HDS object of the type and shape
*     specified and maps it for use as workspace. A pointer to the
*     workspace is returned.  The type specified must be a primitive
*     numeric data type, otherwise an error will be reported.

*  Parameters:
*     type
*        An HDS primitive data type string specifying the type of object
*        to be created (case insensitive).
*     ndim
*        Number of object dimensions.
*     dim
*        Pointer to array holding object dimensions.
*     loc
*        Address at which to return HDS locator to the temporary object.
*     pntr
*        Address at which to return a pointer to the mapped array. The
*        array is not initialised by this routine.
*     status
*        The global status.
