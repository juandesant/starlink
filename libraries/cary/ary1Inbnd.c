*  Name:
*     ary1Inbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Test if the bounds of one array lie inside those of another.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Inbnd( int ndim1, const hdsdim *lbnd1, const hdsdim *ubnd1, int ndim2,
*                     const hdsdim *lbnd2, const hdsdim *ubnd2, int *inside,
*                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine checks to see if the second set of array bounds
*     supplied lie inside the first set. For this purpose, "inside"
*     means that there are no pixels in the second array which are not
*     present in the first. If the arrays are of different
*     dimensionality, then the bounds of the array with lower
*     dimensionality are padded with 1's before testing them. The array
*     bounds information supplied is not checked for validity.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim1
*        Number of dimensions for the first array.
*     lbnd1
*        Lower bounds of the first array.
*     ubnd1
*        Upper bounds of the first array.
*     ndim2
*        Number of dimensions for the second array.
*     lbnd2
*        Lower bounds of the second array.
*     ubnd2
*        Upper bounds of the second array.
*     inside
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether the second array
*        lies inside the first one.
*     status
*        The global status.
