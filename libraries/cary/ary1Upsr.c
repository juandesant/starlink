void ary1Upsr( int copy, HDSLoc **mloc, int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     ary1Upsr

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap a simple array component mapped for READ access.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Upsr( int copy, HDSLoc **mloc, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine unmaps a component of a simple array which has
*     previously been mapped for READ access.

*  Parameters:
*     copy
*        A boolean flag indicating whether mapped access is via a "copy"
*        of the actual data; this indicates whether or not the locator
*        'mloc' is associated with a temporary object.
*     mloc
*        Address of a locator to the HDS object mapped to provide memory
*        locations for the data. This locator will be annulled and reset
*        to a NULL pointer by this routine. If it is associated with a
*        temporary object, then this will be erased.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine attempts to execute even if 'status' is set on
*     entry, although no further error report will be made if it
*     subsequently fails under these circumstances.
*     -  No ACB or MCB structures are updated by this routine.
