*  Name:
*     ary1Xsbnd

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate bounds of the intersection set between two arrays.

*  Synopsis:
*     void ary1Xsbnd( int ndim1, const hdsdim *lbnd1, const hdsdim *ubnd1, int ndim2,
*                     const hdsdim *lbnd2, const hdsdim *ubnd2, int ndim,
*                     hdsdim *lbnd, hdsdim *ubnd, int *exist, int *status )

*  Description:
*     The routine calculates the bounds of the region in common between
*     two arrays, whose lower and upper bounds are supplied. If the
*     dimensionalities of the two arrays differ, then the bounds of the
*     array with lower dimensionality are padded with 1's before
*     calculating the intersection region. The resulting bounds are
*     returned up to the dimensionality limit set by the size of the
*     output arrays; if these require more values than are available,
*     then they are padded with 1's.  If no intersection region exists,
*     then the logical "exist" flag is set to zero to indicate this.
*     No checks are performed to ensure that the array bounds supplied
*     are valid.

*  Parameters:
*     ndim1
*        Number of dimensions for first array.
*     lnmd1
*        Lower bounds of first array.
*     ubnd1
*        Upper bounds of first array.
*     ndim2
*        Number of dimensions for second array.
*     lbnd2
*        Lower bounds of second array.
*     ubnd2
*        Upper bounds of second array.
*     ndim
*        The number of elements in output "lbnd" and "ubnd" arrays.
*     lbnd
*        Returned holding the Lower bounds of the intersection region (if
*        it exists).
*     ubnd
*        Returned holding the Upper bounds of the intersection region (if
*        it exists).
*     exist
*        Returned holding a flag indicating whether the intersection region
*        exists.
*     status
*        The global status.
