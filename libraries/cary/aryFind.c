void aryFind( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, Ary **ary, int *status ) {
/*

*  Name:
*     aryFind

*  Purpose:
*     Find an array in an HDS structure and import it into the ARY_
*     system.

*  Synopsis:
*     void aryFind( HDSLoc *loc, const char *name, Ary **ary, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function finds a named array within an HDS structure, imports
*     it into the ARY_ system and issues an identifier for it. The
*     imported array may then be manipulated by the ARY_ routines.

*  Parameters:
*     loc
*        Locator to the enclosing HDS structure.
*     name
*        Name of the HDS structure component to be imported.
*     ary
*        Address of variable in which to return the Array identifier.
*     status
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  If this routine is called with "status" set, then a NNULL pointer
*     will be returned for the "ary" argument, although no further
*     processing will occur. The same value will also be returned if the
*     routine should fail for any reason.
