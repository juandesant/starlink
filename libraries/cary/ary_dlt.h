/* These are the flag values that are stored within the compressed DATA
   array to indicate how the corresponding uncompressed values are stored:

   - SINGLE_GOOD: The next uncompressed value is the next value to be read
   from the VALUE array.

   - SINGLE_BAD: The next uncompressed value is VAL__BAD, and the one
   after that is the next value to be read from the VALUE array.

   - REPEAT_GOOD: The next "N" uncompressed values are all equal to the next
   value to be read from the VALUE array, where "N" is the next value to
   be read from the REPEAT array.

   - REPEAT_BAD: The next "N" uncompressed values are all VAL__BAD, but
   the "N+1"'th value is good and is equal to the next value to be read
   from the VALUE array. "N" is the next value to be read from the REPEAT
   array.

   - MULTI_GOOD: The next "N" uncompressed values are all single values
   that could not be compressed and should be read from the next "N"
   elements of the VALUE array. "N" is the next value to be read from the
   REPEAT array.

   Any other value in the compressed DATA array is the difference between
   the next uncompressed value and the previous uncompressed value. So
   NEXT = PREVIOUS + DATA. */
