#  Name:
#     hds_link

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against standalone HDS.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building standalone
#     applications which use HDS in order to generate the correct
#     arguments for the compiler (or ld) command. The arguments
#     generated are written to the standard output.
#
#     If the Conly argument is specified, only pure C library routines
#     will be included in the link. No fortran interfaces will be available.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        f77 -o program -L/star/lib `hds_link` program.f

#        Original version.
#     20-DEC-2005 (TIMJ):
#        Split Fortran library from C library and add "Conly" argument
#     24-FEB-2006 (TIMJ):
#        Need starmem
#     26-SEP-2006 (PWD):
#        Don't use Conly for EMS unless we have Conly HDS.
