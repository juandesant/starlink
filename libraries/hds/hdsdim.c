/* Routines to import and export arrays of type hdsdim for use in

/*
 *+
 *  Name:
 *    hdsDimC2F

 *  Purpose:
 *    Convert an array of hdsdim[] to F77_INTEGER_TYPE[]

 *  Invocation:
 *    outdims = hdsDimC2F( int ndim, const hdsdim dims[],
 *                         F77_INTEGER_TYPE fdims[DAT__MXDIM], int * status );

 *  Description:
 *    This function should be used to convert a an array of dimensions
 *    of type hdsdim to an array of dimensions suitable for Fortran
 *    usage. Returns a pointer to an array of F77_INTEGER_TYPE suitable
 *    for the Fortran routine and always fills the Fortran array.

 *  Arguments
 *    ndim = int (Given)
 *       Number of relevant dimensions. Should not exceed DAT__MXDIM.
 *    dims[] = const hdsdim (Given)
 *       Input dimensions to copy, of size ndim.
 *    fdims[DAT__MXDIM] = F77_INTEGER_TYPE (Given & Returned)
 *       Buffer space that can be used to store the copied dimensions.
 *       Will contain the dimensions even if the types for dims and
 *       fdims match.
 *    int *status = Given and Returned
 *       Inherited status. If set, this routine will return NULL.

 *  Return Value:
 *    outdims = F77_INTEGER_TYPE*
 *       Pointer to an array of Fortran integers containing the dimensions.

 *  Authors:
 *    Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
 *    Tim Jenness (Cornell University)

 *  History:
 *    11-JUL-2005 (TIMJ):
 *      Initial version
 *    2014-09-15 (TIMJ):
 *      To ensure that this routine can be used in the fortran
 *      interface we now always guarantee to fill fdims. This is a change of
 *      behavior but allows HDSDIM2INT to be removed from interfaces.

 *  Notes:
 *    - This routine is commonly used to copy the output of a C routine
 *      to a pre-existing Fortran buffer. This requires that fdims[] is
 *      filled regardless of type matching. If the types match then a
 *      fast memmove will be used to do the filling rather than a for loop.
 *    - Status will be set to bad if the C dimension can not fit into
 *      the corresponding Fortran integer.
 *    - The expectation is that this routine is used solely for C
 *      interfaces to Fortran library routines.
 *    - fdims is always filled, so the return value is now always fdims.
 *      It is retained for API compatibility.
